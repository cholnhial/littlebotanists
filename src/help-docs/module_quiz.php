    <p>This is a matching memory game. The game begins with all of the cards face down. Click on a card and it will flip over, showing you a name and image. If the two cards flipped at not a match, they will both return face down. To complete the game you must match the correct cards together. Don&rsquo;t forget to use your memory to remember where each of the cards are!</p>

    <p>Your time will be placed upon a leadership board once you match all the correct pairs.</p>
